            <h2>Reading vs watching</h2>
            <p>Reading is the most efficient way of learning new<br> information. When we say "the most efficient," we
                don't<br> necessarily mean the easiest or the fastest — we refer to<br> how much information you absorb
                relative to the total<br> content consumed. To understand this idea better,<br> consider the following
                example. When you watch a video,<br> you may feel like you understand its main argument<br> perfectly
                well. But in most cases, you'll struggle to<br> remember it later. This happens because you're
                passively<br> consuming the video's content without making the conscious<br> effort to integrate the
                information and create<br> new knowledge. In other words, your attention is<br> drawn to the words and
                images but not to the ideas<br> they're supposed to represent. By contrast, the<br> unique format of our
                magazine sparks the imagination<br> and delivers complex ideas clearly,<br> efficiently, and without any
                unnecessary distractions.</p>

            <h2>Paper vs iPad</h2>
            <p>What was the last thing you did on your phone? Was it<br> checking your messenger or scrolling social
                media feeds? The<br> constant flow of notifications and pop-ups train us<br> to feel like we're
                constantly missing out on<br> something important. In fact, there is an entire industry<br> fighting for
                your attention via your gadget's<br> screen, and it's probably winning. But there is<br> a chance of
                resisting it! Our magazine is a learning<br> space free of pop-ups and ads, and it doesn't<br> have to
                be plugged in or recharged. You can take<br> it anywhere you want, and it's yours for life.</p>

            <h2>OYLA vs others</h2>
            <p>Here are just a few things:<br>
                - No ads<br>
                - High-quality content<br>
                - Accessibility<br>

                You may think that these features on their own are nothing<br> special, but we're offering the
                complete<br> package: 100 pages of science knowledge, colorful graphics,<br> and engaging activities
                with no ads or distractions.<br>

                And this is why we're publishing "another" print magazine<br> —<br> there's really nothing<br>
                like it!</p>

                <p>We just received our first issue and we are<br> VERY impressed with the quality and<br> the content!
                    My
                    daughter is almost 12<br>
                    and she is interested in the topics covered in the<br> issue. I quickly looked through the
                    magazine<br> and
                    I'm interested in
                    reading it as well.<br> Thank you Oyla for such a quick delivery<br> (I placed an order on 11/27)
                    Already
                    looking forward to<br> the

                <p>We just subscribed to OYLA Magazine and our first one<br> arrived yesterday. It's VERY cool. Spent
                    the<br>
                    whole morning talking
                    with Gwen about<br> fractals, where you see them in nature,<br> and how to make them yourself - and
                    we're<br>
                    only a few pages in.
                    It has simple<br> examples and descriptions for the kiddos and then<br> deeper explanations if the
                    parents
                    or kids<br> want to dive
                    in deeper. It was expensive<br>, but its thick and packed tight. Not a lot of<br> empty space, and
                    no ads.
