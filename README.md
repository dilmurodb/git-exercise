This GitHub repo is used for refreshing my git skills

## Note on GitHub branches

> There are two branches on GitHub as of now, one is "main" and the other is "master". "Master" branch was created locally when git was initiated. In order to push local files to remote repo, GitHub repo was created and the HTTP link was used to push the local repo upstream. GitHub repo came with "main" branch. When the local commits were pushed it brought the "Master" branch into GitHub
